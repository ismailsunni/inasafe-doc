For raster data, use gdalwarp, for example
::

   gdalwarp -t_srs EPSG:4326 <source>.tif <target>.tif

For example from TM-3 zone 48.2
::

   ogr2ogr -s_srs EPSG:23834 -t_srs EPSG:4326 <target>.shp <source>.shp

* Why does the plugin not show up in my QGIS Plugin Manager?

One common issue is that if you upgraded from QGIS 1.7.x to 1.8 you may not
get the new plugin repo added to your repo list.
To fix this you can do:

* open QGIS
* Go :menuselection:`Plugins --> Fetch Python Plugins`
* Click :guilabel:`Repositories` tab
* Click :guilabel:`add`
* :guilabel:`Name`: Official QGIS Repository
* :guilabel:`Url`: http://plugins.qgis.org/plugins/plugins.xml
* Save it and the plugin repo list should update.
  If it doesn't, close and open QGIS to force an update.
* In the python plugin manager main tab now you should find |project_name|
  available

**How do I fix KeywordDbError on Windows?**

Itâ€™s an issue related to permission issue.
Normally, it occurs when the keyword.db is not writable by current user.
The thing that you have to do is re-run QGIS as Administrator or re-install
QGIS as Administrator.

Another way to solve it is deleting the registry of |project_name|.
You can do it by opening :guilabel:`regedit` (Registry Editor).
To open regedit, you need to search it in :guilabel:`Start Menu` (it is
usually not shown in Start Menu).

Open regedit.

Find inasafe registry under
:menuselection:`My Computer--> Software --> QGIS --> QGIS --> PythonPlugins`.
After that, right click on the inasafe, and click :guilabel:`Delete`.
Restart QGIS and try to run |project_name| again to see if it works.
